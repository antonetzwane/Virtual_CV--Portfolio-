Virtual Portfolio of Antonet Zwane.

The virtual portfolio consists of six pages or sections namely, Home, About Me, Resume/CV, Skills, Projects and Contact Me. The website is mainly built with programming languages like HTML, CSS and JavaScript and encompasses the skills, my picture, information about me, professional social media (LinkeIn and GitHub) and how an employer can contact me. The website consists of two active pages, an index.html page for the HTML code and a style.css page to make the website look presentable and it's functionality. When the portfolio website is initially opened one will come across a home page which has my picture, and what qualification I have or studying towards which is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, two social media accounts where one can see my projects and achievements and a download CV button to enable an employer to download my CV. The use of Boxicons to help get the social media icons. On your upper right there are different pages on the website where you can navigate or click to go to them. 

Process of creating the portfolio website:

Used VS Code and added an index.html page for the website's functionality.

Added a style.css page for the website to look presentable and be able to function.

Each page on the website has its own designated section seperated by comments to make it easier to review the code in the index.html page.

Different classes such as <div class="social-media> were created to make it easier to navigate.

A CV in a form of a pdf document was added to the website.

An image was added.
